#  K-Means Clustering  

##  Objective  
Perform unsupervised learning using **K-Means Clustering** to group data points into clusters and evaluate the quality of clustering.  

##  Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

##  Steps Followed  
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded dataset (e.g., Mall Customer Segmentation).  
   - Selected relevant numerical features for clustering.  

2. **Elbow Method**  
   - Plotted inertia values for different `k` values.  
   - Identified the optimal number of clusters.  

3. **K-Means Training**  
   - Fitted K-Means with the chosen cluster count.  
   - Assigned cluster labels to each data point.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Calculated **Silhouette Score** to measure clustering quality.  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted clusters in 2D with color-coding.  
   - Marked cluster centroids for better interpretation.  

##  Learning Outcomes  
- Gained hands-on experience with **unsupervised learning**.  
- Learned how to determine the **optimal number of clusters** using the Elbow Method.  
- Understood how to evaluate clustering using **Silhouette Score**.  
- Practiced **data visualization** for cluster interpretation.
